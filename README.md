# laborjava1
I'm Student at the HAW Hamburg University.
This repositories hold my Labor work I get allong the year.
This repository isn't intended for the lazy student who doesn't want 
to do his/her home work.  You should only use the content of this repository if you don't seem to find a solution to your problem and want to see how I solve the same issues you are facing now.

The code hosted here is by no mean perfect.  It is not my goal to make this code perfect too.
